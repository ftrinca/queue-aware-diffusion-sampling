# queue-aware-diffusion-sampling
University project for the Swiss Joint Master in Computer Science (Prof. Lydia Y. Chen, University of Neuchâtel). We study queue-aware diffusion sampling: a simple 3-level policy that adapts sampler (DDPM/DDIM) and step count to queue length, improving latency–quality trade-offs under load.
